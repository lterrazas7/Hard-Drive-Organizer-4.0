Program that will analyze contents of a folder
Distinguish between folders and files in current dir
Once the program recognizes a file it needs to grab files
    modification month/ modification year/ file extension type
the program grabs that info and checks if a folder with those specifications exists
if it does then move file to that folder
if not, create folder and then move file
Program encounters a new dir, program steps into that new dir and process repeats
Once program encounters dir that is empty, delete dir and step back to previous dir


Wants:
    Way for program to stop at dir given from user
        Dir given is where user wants organizing to start
    Function that creates folder for file
        should check if exists first if not then create once and returns it was made

Functions:
    Function that checks if item given to it (dir of item) is file or folder
        returns whether is file or folder

    Function that takes file's year/month/ext type and checks if file exists
        check for folder
        while not exist
            create folder
        return that folder exists

    Function that grabs a list of dir's items
        returns list of items

    Function that deletes current dir if list is empty

    Function that takes current file and extracts file's year/month/ext type
        returns those items


Figuring out how to loop through
if working_dir == starting_dir and working_dir is empty
    quit program


Figure out how to make an "organized folder"
within file path given from user and have the program ignore it
    when file path is given to start organizing and is valid
    program should make a folder, this is where items will be stored
    when getting a list of items from given dir
    the function returning the list should ignore that folder name
    #this should work since the program is going based off of items in returned list?


Concept for files in folder:
    when list gets returned from current folder
    for loop needs to go through each item
    if it encounters a file
        store file name/file path in list - repeat until all files in folder match list
    if it encounters folder
        store folder name/folder path in list - repeat until all folders in folder match list
    #figure out way to match items in current dir to items in both lists
    process files first and start removing items from list containing files
    only when dir is rid of files and list containing files is empty
    may it step into first folder it encounters
        this removes all folders from list and starts over

Steps:
    get user input for path
    check if user input is valid

    while not valid
        ask for valid path
        give option to quit
        check for valid path

    store starting path for later
    assign variable that will change and will be worked on for dir
    #create folder where items will be stored and have list returned not include folder

    while true
        if path is starting and path list is empty
            quit program - it has cycled through everything at this point

        if path returns empty list
            delete current dir in path and move back one spot

        else: - automatic response since list returns with items indicating stuff is in there
            send list of items to function that will divide files and folders into two lists

            if files list is empty
                step into next folder in folders list

            else:
                for loop items in file list
                    working_file =  make object of file - file year, file month, file ext type, file path
                    send object's file year/month/ext type to function that checks if where file is going exists
                    while folder exists returns False:
                        create folder
                        send to check if folders exists
                    move file to that stored folder
    #pick back up here
